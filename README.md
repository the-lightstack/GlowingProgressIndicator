# An animated Glowing Progress Indicator

This code accompanies my [blog post](https://the-lightstack.github.io/mobileAdventures/post/2023-09-02-glowing-indicator/) on how to create this example UI.
The first five commits each complete one step (as in the tutorial) that result in the final app, so (git) check them out and do `flutter run`.
